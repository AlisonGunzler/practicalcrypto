def solve_padding_oracle(ctx, server):
    """
    Recovers the original plaintext message from a given ciphertext using a padding oracle attack.

    Parameters:
        ctx (bytes): A ciphertext produced using AES in CBC mode. The first AES_BLOCK_SIZE bytes
                     of ctx are the Initialization Vector (IV), and the remaining bytes are the ciphertext.

        server (function): A padding oracle function with the signature:
                               server(ciphertext: bytes) -> bool
                           When passed a ciphertext, the server function decrypts it (using the unknown key)
                           and returns True if the resulting plaintext has valid PKCS#7 padding,
                           or False if the padding is invalid.

    Returns:
        bytes: The recovered plaintext message with the padding removed.

def find_cookie_length(device):
    """
    Determines the length (in bytes) of a secret cookie that the device appends to a plaintext message
    before encryption.

    Parameters:
        device (function): A stateful CBC encryption oracle with the signature:
                               device(path: bytes) -> bytes
                           The device takes a bytes object "path" as input and internally constructs a message:
                               msg = path + b";cookie=" + cookie
                           It then pads and encrypts this message using AES in CBC mode.
                           Importantly, the device retains its CBC state between calls, so the encryption is stateful.

    Returns:
        int: The length of the secret cookie (in bytes).

    return 0


def find_cookie(device):
    """
    Recovers the secret cookie that the device appends to the plaintext message before encryption.

    Parameters:
        device (function): A stateful CBC encryption oracle with the signature:
                               device(path: bytes) -> bytes
                           The device builds the message as:
                               msg = path + b";cookie=" + cookie
                           and then pads and encrypts msg using AES in CBC mode, while maintaining the CBC chaining
                           state across calls.

    Returns:
        bytes: The secret cookie that was appended to the plaintext.
